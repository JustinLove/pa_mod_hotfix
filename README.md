# PA Mod Hotfix


A [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding) template for a basic Planitary Annihilation UI mod.  Provides a base to shadow a problem file and then yell at you if the version changes.

The generated template will place large text on the specified scene (`live_game` by default)

Note: you may want to work on a copy of modinfo.json and copy it back if you're using PAMM.  PAMM rewrites the file without formmating every time you toggle enabled.
