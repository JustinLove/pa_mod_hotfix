# PA Mod Hotfix

A [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding) template for a hotfix Planitary Annihilation UI mod.  Provides a base to shadow a problem file and then yell at you if the version changes.

The generated template will place large text on the specified scene (`live_game` by default) and pop up an exit dialog if it doens't match the running game.
